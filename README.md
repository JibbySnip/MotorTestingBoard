# MotorTestingBoard

Simple program to run a motor testing board with 2 spark maxes and 1 talon srx.
Spark maxes are on CAN ports 0 and 1, and the TalonSRX is on port 2.
Single action solenoid is on PCM port 0, and double action is on PCM ports 1 and 2.

Joystick y-axes should control the Spark Maxes, and the TalonSRX can be driven forward with the right joystick and backward with the left joystick.
Single action solenoid is toggled with A, and double action solenoid is toggled with Y.

Good luck with your testing!
