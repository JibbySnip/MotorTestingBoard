# MotorTestingBoard

Simple program to run a motor testing board with 2 spark maxes and 1 talon srx.
Spark maxes are on CAN ports 0 and 1, and the TalonSRX is on port 2.

Joystick y-axes should control the Spark Maxes, and the TalonSRX can be driven forward with the right joystick and backward with the left joystick.

Good luck with your testing!
